# musicdisccrafting
A datapack for minecraft that allows for custom items to be used in the input of a crafting recipe.

The datapack uses music discs and some advancement magic to essentially hijack 18 music disc id's. Every disc uses the 11 music disc's id. Then through the jukebox_playable component gives it it's respective song. That means all 19 discs use one id, but keep their functionality and song. 

Unfortunately that does mean its only 18 id's to play with,

Also this was made in the newest snapshot, using the new item_model component to change the way the custom item looks. It DOES NOT need to be. You can replicate this effect using resource packs.
